#CSS BLOGROLL README

I created this application so that I could jot down bookmarks or information about css that I find useful. The most fun part of this one was making the search bar. Give it a try!

###Things I plan on adding/improving:

* Add date and time of post creation
* Better formatting
* Dont put content as placeholder
* More creative fonts
* Allow markdown formatting
